               Python is an easy to use and easy to learn programming language that is freely available
               on Macintosh, Windows, or Linux computers. So once you learn Python you can use it
               for the rest of your career without needing to purchase any software. This book uses
               the Python 3 language. The earlier Python 2 version of this book is titled "Python
               for Informatics: Exploring Information". There are free downloadable electronic copies
               of this book in various formats and supporting materials for the book at www.pythonlearn.com.
